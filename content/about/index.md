Hello, I'm Manuel Hutter, mostly known as `mhutter` or `dratir` on most online platforms.
I'm a Linux System Engineer & Software Developer with over 15 years of experience.

I currently work for [VSHN AG](https://vshn.ch/) as a System Engineer & Solutions Architect.
My expertises include designing, building & operating Kubernetes-based container platforms, as well as deploying & operating cloud native software on such platforms.

The things I'm most passionate about are automating stuff, and learning new things. I love creating systems that make people's lives easier without being complicated, and learning some new skills along the way.
